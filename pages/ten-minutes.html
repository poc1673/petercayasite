                            <h3 class="section__subtitle">My Journey</h3>
                            <p>My fascination with technology began during my early years when I first encountered a computer in my family's home. What started as curiosity quickly evolved into a passion for understanding how these machines worked. During my time at [University Name], I dove deep into Computer Science, where I discovered my love for software development.</p>
                            
                            <p>After graduating, I joined [First Company] as a junior developer, where I cut my teeth on real-world applications. Over the next few years, I worked my way through various roles, each adding new layers to my technical expertise. Today, I'm a Senior Developer at [Current Company], leading projects that challenge me to grow every day.</p>

                            <p>My primary focus has been on full-stack web development, with particular expertise in:</p>

                            <h3 class="section__subtitle">Professional Philosophy</h3>
                            <p>I believe in writing code that tells a story. Clean, maintainable code isn't just about following best practices‚Äîit's about creating solutions that other developers can understand and build upon. I'm a strong advocate for test-driven development and believe that the best code is code that can be confidently modified and improved over time.</p>

                        <div class="beyond-code">
                            <h3 class="section__subtitle">Beyond the Code</h3>
                            <p>When I'm not immersed in code, I'm an avid photographer who loves capturing the world's beauty through my lens. I believe this creative pursuit helps me bring a unique perspective to problem-solving in technology. I also run a small tech blog where I share my learnings and experiences with the developer community.</p>
                            
                            <p>I'm also passionate about mentoring junior developers and regularly participate in local coding bootcamps. There's something incredibly rewarding about helping others discover their path in technology, just as others once helped me.</p>

                            <p>As technology continues to evolve, I'm particularly excited about the intersection of AI and web development. I'm currently exploring machine learning applications in web interfaces and hope to contribute to making AI more accessible to web developers.</p>
